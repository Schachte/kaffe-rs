**Priority of work**

☐ Need to support some notion of generating static props during build time only and injecting into the JSX before bundling the server bundle
☐ Embed the following files into Kaffe so there isn't any dependency on a client directory
    ☐ build.cjs
    ☐ polyfills/*
    ☐ template.html
    ☐ client-entry.template.tsx
    ☐ server-entry.template.tsx
☐ Enable option for the user to supply their own entry files if needed
☐ Fix any bugs + add tests for Markdown AST + code generation
☐ Add a simple way of validating JSX after Markdown HTML generation, but rely on esbuild to do the transformation of JSX -> HTML
☐ Implement a way to copy project files in tmp/ dir from users directory so relative paths match correctly when doing bundle generation
☐ Allow template.html to be supplied by the user
☐ Look into code splitting + manifest creation to support multiple bundles in a single file to reduce amount of JS/data passed in each request
